100q9kw,"Yo, Happy... Almost making a complete loop around an arbitrary point in orbit around the sun day. The mods have been notified of numerous affiliate accounts rising up particularly in December It would be hypocritical of me to remove these accounts entirely as I also make money off of PE... In a different way through coaching and PE adjacent products. I think we do have a rule against balant product promotion but the smarter ones use choice wording to get around it technically However... I want it to be known that I don t necessarily condone of these practices... Particularly when the product is not as great as the company says. A few years ago it was nothing but bathmate hydromax plaguing PE.... Don t get me wrong. It s good but it s not the holygrail these affiliates made it out to be. Now we have another company... Doing a similar tactic... Totalman Totalman used to have a pretty decent package but as most companies do... It s a race to bottom in cost and race to the top in profits... So they stoppes making their good extenders and started selling an inferior version that is much easier and cheaper to produce That is beside the point In this era of online marketing... It is much more effective to use influencers to build trust and sell a product than it is to make ads... Because they will do a lot more work than an ad buy ever will So we have a few hustlers trying to make a name for themselves... Build a following and sell heating pads in hopes they can make 10 dollars off of you when you buy from their link. I have seen the same talking points from multiple affiliates this month... To these guys... Try harder... if you want people to actually take you seriously... Don t just copy and paste the TM approved talking point to make a novel reason why you need a heating pad in general. One of you said you want to be like me... Do you see me shilling out other products? This post is to be a warning to you new guys... If they paint a flawless picture of a product they are not being genuine... If you read the same points over and over again about the same product with little downsides they are almost certainly shilling I do make product recommendations. I don t take money from the companies. I usually buy the product with my own cash first... So I can speak freely. I am yet to find a flawless method, I am yet to find something that is 10x better than the alternative... It usually just comes down to preference Heating pads for example .. I have used IR and copper coils.... They work just about the same ... IR is easier to control the temperature however but for the 3x in cost is it really worth it... Probably not. TLDR Watch out for affiliates they don t have your best interest at heart. Make sure you do your own research on the products and check the usernames of commenters to rule out any patterns",Im an affiliate but I actually care about my reputation. I enjoy experimenting with new devices but if it s bullshit ima call it bullshit that s why I could make a post like this followed by a post like this I only became a Total Man affiliate because the OG was so good. I used it religiously And nothing at that price point compared to it. But I m extremely honest about the new line being complete trash. I ve made endless comments stating that in hopes of helping guys save some money I was waiting for this post. you make a great point when you said December we all knew exactly who you were referring to he knows too that why he s so mad. I think he assumed the rebrand would work. I tried give him some solid advice to be less annoying but he didn t take it,discussion,unknown,bd19962015,19Expansion2X,2,2023-01-01T16:37:42

100q9kw,His shit is exactly what I come to this sub to avoid. It was worse as ChemSexCouple but still gets ridiculous under the new name.

I use other products that the ones I am affiliated with, and I purchased them before I was ever affiliated with them with my own money. I want to apologize about spamming my routine last night.

100q9kw,"Formerly known as u ChemSexCouple before he went apeshit and ruined his reputation. I can see now he s attempting to be more mature but not for the right reasons. Hes already taking the easy way out via deception by trying to change his name. On top of that both of his accounts are brand new and per his username it appears chemically enhanced PE, which is now not disclosed in any comments I ve seen since he rebranded . Chem PE is fine but don t act like your routine is the source of your gains. Reminds you of someone? cough Liver King cough cough",His shit is exactly what I come to this sub to avoid.

100q9kw,"Dude made a post saying he was going to change, then he changed his name and affiliate codes which identified him by that name. Lol. At least he s not going around trolling people again...yet.","I fully understand BD s point about trying to not be hypocritical about monetization of PE. But back when he was CSC... he was trying to say it wasn t fair to target him by comparing himself to actual veterans who ve put decades into what they do. There is a MASSIVE DIFFERENCE between a guy cobbling together a PE Workout Plan based on bits and pieces of other people s established routines and actually BEING the guys who came up with those routines through hours of literal sweat, blood, and injury. CSC HH s has not sat woodshedding for hours, days, weeks, and months, like guys like Ben with Malehanger, or M9, or the Total Man guy regardless of current reviews . Those guys have dedicated years if not decades to making a safe path for all of us WHILE monetizing their hard work. BD is doing the same. This guy has tried to develop a character .... 2 now actually, and tries to PM people a routine built on the backs of other people s hard work, then tacks on affiliate links based on products that he didn t create. He s literally a drop shipper with a copy paste workout routine . HunterHangz... if you re reading this I m not here to attack you, dude. I get it. I once drop shipped Doc Johnson Vibrating Pearl VIBRATORS back in the day and my tactics were the same. I m peacefully trying to get you to understand what you are doing here... even the more chilled out version you re presenting under your new account is still spam. Posting comments on this board and following them up with Hit me up! , Message me bro , and linking Hunterz Routine Here all over this sub... whether it is allowed or not is still spammy AF. You can do what you did under your old username, which was call us haters , tell us Peace Bro! all you want. But everyone recognizes what you re doing. You might part a few from their money but I ve worked in internet sales since the internet was a thing dude. You re not going to get your return on time investment doing what you re doing. Affiliates only make the people above them richer. Just stop and contribute man. Please.",unknown,unknown,tobeginpe,fotw75,9,2023-01-01T14:34:52

100q9kw,"Yo, Happy... Almost making a complete loop around an arbitrary point in orbit around the sun day. The mods have been notified of numerous affiliate accounts rising up particularly in December It would be hypocritical of me to remove these accounts entirely as I also make money off of PE... In a different way through coaching and PE adjacent products. I think we do have a rule against balant product promotion but the smarter ones use choice wording to get around it technically However... I want it to be known that I don t necessarily condone of these practices... Particularly when the product is not as great as the company says. A few years ago it was nothing but bathmate hydromax plaguing PE.... Don t get me wrong. It s good but it s not the holygrail these affiliates made it out to be. Now we have another company... Doing a similar tactic... Totalman Totalman used to have a pretty decent package but as most companies do... It s a race to bottom in cost and race to the top in profits... So they stoppes making their good extenders and started selling an inferior version that is much easier and cheaper to produce That is beside the point In this era of online marketing... It is much more effective to use influencers to build trust and sell a product than it is to make ads... Because they will do a lot more work than an ad buy ever will So we have a few hustlers trying to make a name for themselves... Build a following and sell heating pads in hopes they can make 10 dollars off of you when you buy from their link. I have seen the same talking points from multiple affiliates this month... To these guys... Try harder... if you want people to actually take you seriously... Don t just copy and paste the TM approved talking point to make a novel reason why you need a heating pad in general. One of you said you want to be like me... Do you see me shilling out other products? This post is to be a warning to you new guys... If they paint a flawless picture of a product they are not being genuine... If you read the same points over and over again about the same product with little downsides they are almost certainly shilling I do make product recommendations. I don t take money from the companies. I usually buy the product with my own cash first... So I can speak freely. I am yet to find a flawless method, I am yet to find something that is 10x better than the alternative... It usually just comes down to preference Heating pads for example .. I have used IR and copper coils.... They work just about the same ... IR is easier to control the temperature however but for the 3x in cost is it really worth it... Probably not. TLDR Watch out for affiliates they don t have your best interest at heart. Make sure you do your own research on the products and check the usernames of commenters to rule out any patterns","There s this prick who keeps posting his routine which is convoluted and takes like 4 hours as a comment under any post which could in some way be seen as related to PE. Of course, the routine is full of self promotion and affiliate links. His name is Something _Hangz",discussion,unknown,bd19962015,gbuser2022,11,2023-01-01T12:10:58

Any devices will work, those are just the ones I found success with. I use other products that the ones I am affiliated with, and I purchased them before I was ever affiliated with them with my own money. I want to apologize about spamming my routine last night. I was drunk and I thought I could solve everyone s problem. Again, any devices will work! Aliexpress, Ebay whatever. These are just the products I found success with.",discussion,unknown,bd19962015,Hunter_Hangz,-16,2023-01-01T13:09:00

I can see now he s attempting to be more mature but not for the right reasons. Hes already taking the easy way out via deception by trying to change his name. On top of that both of his accounts are brand new and per his username it appears chemically enhanced PE, which is now not disclosed in any comments I ve seen since he rebranded . Chem PE is fine but don t act like your routine is the source of your gains. Reminds you of someone? cough Liver King cough cough",unknown,unknown,gbuser2022,tobeginpe,16,2023-01-01T13:48:21
